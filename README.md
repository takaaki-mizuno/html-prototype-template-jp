# HTML Prototype template for Cursor

This template is for creating HTML prototypes of any services using an Generative AI by an IDE such as Cursor. Even if you do not have knowledge of HTML, you can create HTML prototypes by writing service specifications in natural language and providing simple prompts to the AI. 

## How to use

1. Write the service specifications in [specifications.md](specifications.md) (Either English or other languages are fine).
2. Provide a simple prompt to the AI agent ( Cursor Composer ) to develop the prototype.

The way to give instructions is as follows:

```
Based on the content of @specifications.md, build a landing page of the service in index.html.
```
